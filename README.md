## Introduction

Welcome to the Market Segmentation project repository! This project aims to explore and segment a market dataset using data analysis and machine learning techniques. Market segmentation is a critical aspect of marketing strategy, allowing businesses to understand their customer base better and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly.

In this repository, you will find code, data, and documentation related to the project. This README will provide you with an overview of the project, its components, and how to use them.

## Data

The project's dataset is contained in the file `McD CaseStudy.ipynb`. This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code and analysis of the market data. The dataset is proprietary and not included in this repository, but you can access it separately for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) is documented in the file `Harshit Katheria (Step 4 Exploring Data).pdf`. This document provides insights into the initial data exploration, including summary statistics, data visualization, and key findings.

## Market Segmentation

The primary focus of this project is market segmentation. The segmentation analysis is outlined in the file `Market Segmentation.pdf`, which provides an overview of the methodology and results of the segmentation process.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshuuuuuuuu/Market-Segmentation.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. Access the dataset separately and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file (McD CaseStudy.ipynb).

4. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file to explore the dataset and analyze market segmentation.

5. Please note that you must obtain the dataset separately, as it is not included in this repository due to proprietary reasons.
